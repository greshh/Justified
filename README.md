# Justified Alignment
***Start:** (roughly) May 4<sup>th</sup> 2022, **Finish:** May 19<sup>th</sup> 2022*

For a first-year course: Applied Programming

## Scenario
This program reads in and justifies a line of text to fit a column of width 40. Justification is achieved by:
- finding the gaps between words
- increasing the gaps to have more spaces
- some gaps may require one more space than some other gaps

When the program is running, the display should look like this:
```
Enter a line of text: Hello there! How are you today?
```
```
1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
Hello  there!   How   are   you   today?
```
The "justification ruler", which is exactly 40 characters in length, is displayed on screen.

**Notes:**
- Input will always be in several words with a single space between each word.
- The input must not be greater than 40 characters - error handling is achieved if otherwise.

## What I learnt:
- Function declaration and definition.
